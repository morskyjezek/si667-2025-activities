**Note:** The following examples use the `%` symbol to indicate the prompt.
The text before the prompt indicates the directory, or location of the command prompt.
If you have "moved" your prompt using a command like `cd`,
your responses may be slightly different.
Remember that the location context is all important in this interface!
The commands below assume you start in the `si667-2025` directory.

See below for solutions or explanations of the problems and questions:

## Problem 1 {#problem-1}

**Question:** Viewing the file's bytes. Choose one of the JPG files. Investigate and answer:

1. What file are you working with? _Provide a file name._
2. Look at the first 16 bytes. What do you see? Can you confirm that this is a JPG file? _Open the file with a hex viewer. To confirm that this is a JPG, you are looking for a file signature, sometimes called a "magic number," usually the first bytes notated in hex are `FF D8 FF`._
3. What two-byte sequence represents the SOS marker in a JPG file? _Represented in hex notation, this is `FF DA`._
4. Where does the image stream start? _You are looking for the SOS marker, and the "byte offset," which indicates how far into the the bitstream the image information starts. This varies by image, see below:_
```bash
file                        offset (in hex, begins with 0x)
AY2ghfD.jpg                 0x1A5
ecce-homo-half-deleted.jpg  0x4AC
ecce-homo.jpg               0x4AC
```
5. Look at at least one TIFF, PNG, and SVG file using the same process. Can you identify the file signatures there? _Varies by image type. See list of file signatures under Resources._

## Problem 2 {#problem-2}

**Question:** Modifying the bitstream, or more interestingly, creating Glitch art: Use the files in the "PKG-images" directory. Choose one of the JPG files. Investigate the following and answer the questions:

1. What file are you examining? _Provide a file name._
2. Create a copy (you can do this using "Save As..." in VSCode, or copying in your GUI file navigator, you can use the cp command). _Action. Varies depending on what method you use, and what system you're working on._
3. Open the copied file in a hex viewer. What are the first two bytes in hexadecimal notation? _This should be the same as the source image, so the signature should match JPG, meaning `FF DA`.
4. Locate the "Start of Stream" (SOS) marker. Modify anything after that - insert, copy or cut and paste, delete. _Action. Use the search function to locate the SOS marker, and make changes after that._
5. Save the file, open it in an image viewer, and see what's happened. _Results will vary, but if you create the copy, make changes in the hex viewer, save, and then reload in a viewer, you should see some changes in the resulting display or "performance" of the image. Sometimes changes will be very tiny, sometimes they may break the image or cause it not to display._
6. You may want to iterate on this a few times, or retry. Sometimes it's interesting, sometimes it's not. _Same as previous question._

## Problem 3 {#problem-3}

**Question:** Create checksums for the JPG files (including your newly created "glitch art" from the previous question!)

1. Use the command `md5` (Mac) or `md5sum` (Windows/GitBash) to create and record the checksum for each of the JPG files. What is the command you will use to do this in one command? _Either of these should work:_
```bash
% md5 *.jpg 
% md5sum *.jpg
```
2. List the names of the files and the corresponding MD5 checksums for each of the JPG files in the directory.
```bash
b5858bcfd7ec56fb045a66d4180d82f6 AY2ghfD.jpg
fdd41f48a605835588e165387e7e9d5d ecce-homo-glitched.jpg
59f8c5c60d3c9eda04c8264117c42441 ecce-homo-half-deleted.jpg
6afdab5c76fa96b66a86f9d7b4a28e31 ecce-homo.jpg
```
_Ideally, you can output this to a text file, so you have the data to save or confirm later on._
3. If the command line tools aren't working for you, try out the Web-based checksum tool linked above.
4. _Goal:_ a report that lists the MD5 checksum and the file name, separated by a space, on a single line for each file

## Problem 4 {#problem-4}

**Question:** Compare the checksums of the files related to your glitch art, specifically the original and modified files. Are they the same or different? _These should be different values, indicating that the bitstream (and the corresponding file object) is no longer the same._

## Problem 5 {#problem-5}

**Question:** What do you find notable about viewing files in this way? What is the difference between the text files (extensions like: txt, csv, md) and the graphic files (extensions like: jpg, tiff, png)? _Answers will vary, but should be something along the lines of this being a different way of understanding digital stuff, perhaps even a different "materiality" or view of the data. Observations or thoughts on this question are offered by various readings in the first few weeks, including Owens, Kirschenbaum, Becker, and others._

## BONUS

Try reopening any of the graphic files that you edited (tif, png, jpg, etc) with a graphic viewer (like a web browser, Mac Preview, or other program). Can you view the files as graphics? If the files are inaccessible after you edit them, what do you think broke these files? Were there any files/filetypes that didn't "break" as easily?

To earn one extra point: Post any interesting images that are created in the online discussion: Glitch Art Gallery on Canvas.
