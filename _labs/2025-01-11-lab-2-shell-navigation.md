## Questions to Answer

1. Imagine that you have opened a window that gives access to the command line. What command would you use to determine your current location (current path address)?
2. What command would you use to move to another directory or folder?
3. What command would you use to list the contents of the directory or folder?
4. You can request a basic list (names of files and directories) and an advanced list (that shows permissions, file size, path, etc)? What command and options would you use to generate the basic list? What commands and options generate the advanced list?
5. Problem: During class, you downloaded and unzipped somecourse files (see [Wk 2 slide no. 54](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sypWW3IgJmkIY9WFDMWLmuJJIRO5oQfS273oyTYoWPw/edit#slide=id.g2b0fe4c1013_1_19)). If you didn't complete that activity, download the files, unzip them, and keep track of where the files are located. In a command shell window, navigate to the location of those files. Once you are there, print a list of the files in that location. Compare the list of files you see with the list of files listed in the [course GitHub repository]({{ site.course_data_repo_link }}). Can you identify the same files in both locations?
6. What have you learned about using the command line? Are there situations or tasks where you imagine this environment to be more (or less) useful than the graphical interface of the Explorer or Finder?
