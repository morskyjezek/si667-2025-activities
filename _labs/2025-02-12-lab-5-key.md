This page provides solutions and explanations of the problems for [Lab 4]({% link _labs/2025-02-04-lab-5-metadata-embedded-and-inventory.md %}).

# Lab Questions

The lab questions focus on two tools: Siegfried and Brunnhilde. These tools will be demonstrated again in class, but work through these problems to start gaining familiarity with the tools.

## Problem 1: Setup {#problem-1}

These tools will generate reports about the files in the directory, so you will first create those directories. Use the `mkdir` command to make two new directories in the directory one level above the course files, one titled `sf_out` and the second `br_out`. For example, if you have saved the course files in a folder you use for the course titled `si667-notes`, create these new directories in that notes directory.

_The tasks of this problem are to set up your work environment. You can name the folders you're working with whatever makes sense to you, but if you use the above, you should have a structure something like this:_

## Problem 2: Running Siegfried {#problem-2}

Siegfried is a useful tool to create an inventory and a bulk process for file characterization information. Run the command on the `si667-2025` directory and output the reports to the `sf_out` directory.

1. At the prompt (located one level above the si667-2025 directory), run the command `sf si667-2025/`. What did the command do? (What files and directory have been created by the command? What do you see in the files?)  
_This runs Siegried and prints the output to the terminal screen. If you scan the output, you should note that this has consistent information about each of the files in the target directory._
2. At the prompt, enter the following command: 
```bash
sf si667-2025/ > sf_out/sf_fileid_report_202502.yaml
```
Now what happens? What did the command do?  
_This should output the information created in the previous step to a file with the name `sf_fileid_report_202502.yaml` in the siegfried reports directory. The output of the command may look something like this:_

3. The previous command should have created some new files in the `sf_out` directory. Open the `sf_out` directory and look around. Answer the following:
    1. What did the command do?  
    _Created a new file named `sf_fileid_report_202502.yaml`._
    2. What does the file tell you?  
    _It has file characterization information about each file in the directory._
    3. Open the new file in a text editor (e.g., VS Code). How would you characterize the data presented in the file?
    _Answers may vary, but you should note that this seems to be consistently structured information, it is plain text, and it provides basic stat information, including file name and path, file size, and it also provide characterization information like a PRONOM ID, MIME type, and an explanation for the determination of this information._
    4. Does anything strike you as particularly useful? What is odd or questionable about the output?  
    _Answers will vary, but a few things of note include: this file is independent and can be saved, as a list of information containing PDI information, it is plain text and does not require any additional software beyond a text editory, and it contains a list of all the files in the directory, including hidden files._

## Problem 3: Running Brunnhilde {#problem-3}

Brunnhilde produces useful summary reports, as well as the detailed, item-level reports of Siegfried. Your task is to follow the steps demonstrated in the screencast to run `brunnhilde.py` to analyze the files in the sample file group (instructions on the slide titled, ["Run Brunnhilde"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MGSl026DkESWXIOaCNw8tLdZCVhv5Iq1i_WNfGFPxjU/edit?usp=sharing)). Look at the files that were output when you ran the script, and answer the following:
  1. What did the command do? (What files and directory have been created by the command? What do you see in the files?)
  2. Focus on the `report.html` file that was created. Take a look at the report (open it in a browser to read it): are there duplicate files, if so, how many? What is the most common image type file (check the MIME Types)? What is the most common application type of file?
  3. Are there any duplicate files? If so, what are they named, and how do you think duplicates are identified here?
  4. In the `report.html` file, look at any of the tables with an "ID" column. What is the information in this column? If you click on any of the links in these columns, where does it take you? What information can you learn at these links?
  5. Look at the "unidentified" section of `report.html`. Could you identify any of the files that are listed there? Why do you think the tool was unable to identify these? Now look at the "warnings" section of `report.html`. How could the information in this section be used to address the questions left in the "unidentified" section?
